# hacker_match


## Inspiration
As frequent participants in hackathons, we've often found it challenging to assemble the perfect team to bring our innovative ideas to life. We've experienced the frustration of searching for teammates with the right skills, enthusiasm, and experience to complement our own. To address this common issue in the hackathon community, we created Hacker Match, a platform designed to simplify the process of finding and connecting with like-minded hackers, thereby forming dream teams for hackathons.

## What it does
Hacker Match is a social media platform that streamlines the team-building process for hackathons. The platform begins by allowing users to create profiles where they can showcase their skills, display their hackathon experience, and indicate the hackathons they are currently attending or planning to attend. Once registered and signed in, users can browse and connect with other hackers based on shared interests, complementary skills, or personal preferences.

## How I built it
Our tech stack included **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** for programming, **TailwindCSS** for a sleek and responsive user interface, **NextJS** to provide seamless and efficient routing within the platform, **Firebase** to utilize its database and authentication services, and **Vercel** to deploy it onto the web and make it accessible to the hackathon community.
